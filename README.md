# Gimme Colours

This is a very simple CLI tool which will render the 16 basic colours to your terminal. Helpful for testing your terminal personalisation settings, this tool uses the `chalk` library to generate the colours and display the text.

The colours are in line with the `settings.json` file for Windows Terminal.
